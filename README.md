# GeometryCalculations
Just some geometry calculations for C# practice. Although much of this is basic C# level I have included advanced techniques such as Lamda and LINQ expressions. I plan to show both block and experssion methods as well as Generics and Delegates. I may make duplicate projects where one version is basic -> Imtermediate and another is ikntermediate -> advanced.
